# Prediction-of-Day-Ahead-Electricity-Prices-using-Neural-Networks

In recent years, predicting the prices of electricity has become a vital part of energy producers as it has direct input on decision making. In this lab we were provided with Belpex price data using which we implemented a neural network that is able to predict the future values based on the training of model. The load factors of wind and solar energy are also utilized to reduce MSE (mean square error). Lags from previous prices were also used to reduce MSE.
